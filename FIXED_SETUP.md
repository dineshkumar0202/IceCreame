## ✅ All Issues Fixed

The code has been completely fixed and is now working properly. Here's what was resolved:

## 🗄️ Database Setup

The application will automatically connect to MongoDB. To seed the database with initial data:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

## 🛠️ Environment Configuration

The server uses these environment variables (already configured in `/server/.env`):

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/icecream_shop
JWT_SECRET=icecream_jwt_secret_key_2024_development
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## ⏹️ Stopping the Application

To stop all services:
```bash
pkill -f 'mongod\|nodemon\|vite'
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **MongoDB not starting**: Check if port 27017 is available
2. **Permission errors**: Run `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /data/db`
3. **Port conflicts**: Change ports in the configuration files
4. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in both client and server directories
